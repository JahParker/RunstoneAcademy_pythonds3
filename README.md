# RunestoneAcademy_pythonds3

This is a repository for Problem Solving With Algorithms and Data Structures 3rd edition, or pythonds3 for short, hosted on [https://runestone.academy](runstone.academy).

Throughout this course, I will be updating this repo to show off my code and progress when completing lessons and attempting the exercises.

My goal is to have a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms while also implementing version control via Github.
